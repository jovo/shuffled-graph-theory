\begin{abstract}
Graph classification algorithms often do not incorporate vertex label information in their classifiers.  In this work, we investigate the extent to which discarding vertex labels can hinder classification performance, and for which random graph models one might expect this invariance to be impactful.  Via theory we demonstrate a collection of results.  Specifically, if one ``shuffles'' the graphs prior to classification, the vertex label information is irretrievably lost, which can degrade misclassification performance (and often does).  A specific graph-invariant classifier is shown to be Bayes optimal.  Moreover, this classifier may be induced by training data in a consistent and efficient fashion.  Unfortunately, both computational and sample size burdens make this ``plugin'' classifier impractical.  A graph-matched Frobenius norm $k_n$ nearest neighbor (GM-$k$NN) classifier, however, is also universally consistent, and expected to converge faster whenever ``nearness'' implies same class.  Finally, we apply this approach to a connectome classification problem (a connectome is brain-graph where vertices correspond to (groups of) neurons and edges correspond to connections between them).  The  GM-$k$NN classifier on the shuffled graphs performs better than a more standard graph-invariant based $k$NN strategy, but not quite as well as the standard $k$NN on the labeled graphs.  Thus, we demonstrate the practical utility of the theoretical derivations herein.  Extending these results to weighted and (certain) attributed random graph models is straightforward.

\section{Introduction} \label{sec:1}

\IEEEPARstart{R}{epresenting} data as graphs is becoming increasingly popular, as technological progress facilitates measuring ``connectedness'' in a variety of domains, including social networks, trade-alliance networks, and brain networks.  While the theory of pattern recognition is deep \cite{Devroye1996}, previous theoretical efforts regarding pattern recognition almost invariably assume data are collections of vectors.  Here, we assume data are collections of graphs (where each graph is a set of vertices and a set of edges connecting the vertices).  For some data sets, the vertices of the graphs are \emph{labeled}, that is, one can identify the vertex of one graph with a vertex of the others.  For others, the labels are either unobserved or assume to not exist.  We investigate the theoretical and practical implications of the absence of vertex labels.  

These implications are especially important in the emerging field of ``connectomics'', the study of connections of the brain \cite{Hagmann05, Sporns10}.  In connectomics, one represents the brain as a graph (a brain-graph), where vertices correspond to (groups of) neurons and edges correspond to connections between them.  In the lower part of the evolutionary hierarchy (e.g., worms and flies), many neurons have been assigned labels \cite{White86}.  However, for even the simplest vertebrates, vertex labels are mostly unavailable when vertices correspond to neurons.  A common strategy for dealing with this ``unmatchedness'' is to operate in a quotient space of graphs.  In the quotient space, a vertex represents a collection of neurons, and this collection is assigned a label.  Edges become multi-edges, although they are commonly binarized to obtain simple graphs \cite{Hagmann2010}.  Operating in the quotient space of labeled vertices eases graph comparison, as the ``graph-matching'' sticky-wicket is avoided. Embedding the unlabeled graphs in this quotient space will likely be advantageous for some exploitation tasks, and disastrous for others (for instance, whenever the vertex labels contain all the signal for the specified task).  We aim to understand under what circumstances one could expect a classification performance degradation, and to what extent we can recover from losing the vertex label information.


% \IEEEPARstart{T}{his} work addresses graph classification in the presence of vertex label shuffling.   
% Consider the following idealized scenario.  Vertex labels may or may not be observed.  In the latter case, vertex $v$ in one graph cannot be assumed to correspond to vertex $v$ in another graph.  Comparing collections of graphs is therefore more difficult in this latent label situation. 


% Graph classification differs from classification of vector-valued random variables in several key aspects.  First, the structure of a graph may encode information.  Second, the vertex labels may or may not be observed.  In unobserved scenarios, NP-hard problems rear their ugly heads \cite{Conte2004}. 


\section{Graph Classification Models} % (fold)
\label{sec:shuffler_graph_class_models}

\subsection{A labeled graph classification model} % (fold)
\label{sub:a_labeled_graph_classification_model}

% subsection a_labeled_graph_classification_model (end)


A (labeled) graph $G=(\mc{V},\mc{E})$ consists of a vertex set, $\mc{V}=[n]$, where $n < \infty$ is the number of vertices and $[n]=\{1,\ldots, n\}$, and an edge set $\mc{E} \subseteq \binom{[n]}{2}$.
Let $\GG\colon \Omega \to \mc{G}_n$ be a graph-valued random variable taking values $G\in \mc{G}_n$, where $\mc{G}_n$ is the set of graphs on $n$ vertices, and $|\mc{G}_n|=2^{\binom{n}{2}}=d_n$. 
Let $Y$ be a categorical random variable, $Y\colon \Omega \to \mc{Y}=\{y_1,\ldots, y_{c}\}$, where $c< \infty$.  Assume the existence of a joint distribution, $\PP_{\GG,Y}$ which can be decomposed into the product of a class-conditional distribution (likelihood) $\PP_{\GG|Y}$ and a class prior $\pi_Y$. Because $n$ is finite, the class-conditional  distributions $\PP_{\GG | Y=y}=\PP_{\GG|y}$ can be considered discrete distributions $\text{Discrete}(G; \bth_y)$, where $\bth_y$ is an element of the $d_n$-dimensional unit simplex $\triangle_{d_n}$ (satisfying $\theta_{G|y}\geq 0$ $\forall G \in \mc{G}_n$ and $\sum_{G \in \mc{G}_n} \theta_{G|y}=1$).


% $\bth_y=[\theta_{1|y},\ldots \theta_{d|y}]\T \in \triangle_d$, where  $d=|\mc{G}_n|=2^{\binom{n}{2}}$ and $\triangle_d$ is the $d$-dimensional simplex (that is, $\theta_{i|y}\geq 0$ for all $i \in [d]$ and $\sum_{i \in [d]} \theta_{i|y}=1$). 

\subsection{A shuffled graph classification model} % (fold)
\label{sub:a_shuffled_graph_classification_model}

% subsection a_shuffled_graph_classification_model (end)

In the above, it was implicitly assumed that the vertex labels were observed.  However, in certain situations (such as the motivating connectomics example presented in Section \ref{sec:1}), this assumption is unwarranted.  To proceed, we define two graphs $G,G' \in \mc{G}_n$ to be isomorphic if and only if there exists a vertex permutation (shuffle) function $\Qs\colon\mc{G}_n \to \mc{G}_n$ such that $\Qs(G)=G'$.  Let $\QQ$ be a permutation-valued random variable, $\QQ\colon\Omega \to \mc{Q}_n$, where $\mc{Q}_n$ is the space of vertex permutation functions on $n$ vertices so that $|\mc{Q}_n|=n!$.  Extending the model to include this vertex shuffling distribution yields $\PP_{\QQ,\GG,Y}$.  We assume throughout this work (with loss of generality) that the shuffling distribution is both \emph{class independent} and \emph{graph independent}; therefore, this joint model can be decomposed as
\begin{align}
	\PP_{\QQ,\GG,Y} = \PP_{\QQ} \PP_{\GG,Y} = \PP_{\QQ} \PP_{\GG |Y} \pi_Y.
\end{align}
As in the labeled case, the shuffled graph class-conditional distributions $\PP_{\QQ(\GG)|y}$ can be represented by discrete distributions $\text{Discrete}(G; \bth_y')$, where again $\bth_y' \in \triangle_{d_n}$.  When $\PP_{\QQ}$ is uniform on $\mc{Q}_n$, all shuffled graphs within the same isomorphism set are equally likely; that is  $\{\theta_{G_i|y}' = \theta_{G_j|y}' \, \forall G_i,G_j \colon \Qs(G_i)=G_j$ for some $\Qs \in \mc{Q}_n\}$.


\subsection{An unlabeled graph classification model} % (fold)
\label{sub:an_unlabeled_graph_classification_model}

% subsection an_unlabeled_graph_classification_model (end)

Let $\mt{\mc{G}}_n$ be the collection of isomorphism sets.
An \emph{unlabeled graph} $\mt{G}$ is an element of $\mt{\mc{G}}_n$. The number of unlabeled graphs on $n$ vertices is $|\mt{\mc{G}}_n|=\mt{d}_n \approx d/n!$ (see \cite{A000088} and references therein).
% , and $|\mt{\mc{G}}_n|=\mt{d}_n$.  
An \emph{isomorphism function} $U\colon \mc{G}_n \to \mt{\mc{G}}_n$ is a function that takes as input a graph and outputs the corresponding unlabeled graph. Let $\mt{\GG}\colon \Omega \to \mt{\mc{G}}_n$ be an unlabeled graph-valued random variable taking values $\mt{G} \in \mt{\mc{G}}_n$.   The joint distribution over unlabeled graphs and classes is therefore
$\PP_{\mt{\GG},Y}=\PP_{U(\GG),Y}=\PP_{U(\QQ(\GG)),Y}$, which decomposes as $\PP_{\mt{\GG}|Y} \pi_Y$. The class-conditional distributions $\PP_{\mt{\GG} | y}$ over isomorphism sets (unlabeled graphs) can also be thought of as discrete distributions $\text{Discrete}(\mt{G}; \mb{\mt{\theta}}_y)$ where $\mb{\mt{\theta}}_y\in \triangle_{\mt{d}_n}$ are vectors in the $\mt{d}_n$-dimensional unit simplex.   Comparing shuffling and unlabeling for the independent and uniform shuffle distribution $\PP_{\QQ}$, we have $\{\theta_{G|y}'=\mt{\theta}_{\mt{G}|y}/|\mt{G}|$ for all $G \in \mt{G}\}$.  




\section{Bayes Optimal Graph Classifiers} % (fold)
\label{sec:bayes_optimal_graph_classifiers}

We consider graph classification in the three scenarios described above: labeled, shuffled, and unlabeled.  To proceed, in each scenario we define three mathematical objects: (i) a classifier, (ii) the Bayes optimal classifier, and (iii) the Bayes risk.

\subsection{Bayes Optimal Labeled Graph Classifiers} % (fold)
\label{sub:labeled_graph_classifiers}

% subsection labeled_graph_classifiers (end)

% \begin{itemize}
	% \item 
	A \emph{labeled graph classifier} $h\colon \mc{G}_n \to \mc{Y}$ is any function that maps from labeled graph space to class space. The risk of a labeled graph classifier under $0-1$ loss is the expected misclassification rate $L(h)=\EE[h(\GG)\neq Y]$, where the expectation is taken against $\PP_{\GG,Y}$.

\subsection{Bayes Optimal Shuffled Graph Classifiers} % (fold)

A \emph{shuffled graph classifier} is also any function $h\colon \mc{G}_n \to \mc{Y}$ (note that the set of shuffled graphs is the same as the set of labeled graphs). However, by virtue of the input being a shuffled graph as opposed to a labeled graph, the shuffled risk under $0-1$ loss is given by $L'(h)=\EE[h(\QQ(\GG)) \neq Y]$, where the expectation is taken against $\PP_{\QQ(\GG),Y}$. %As above, 
% \begin{align}
% h'_*=\argmin_{h \in \mc{H}} L'(h).	
% \end{align}
% The \emph{shuffled Bayes risk}, $L'_*=L'(h'_*)$, depends on $\PP_{\QQ,\GG,Y}$.

The \emph{shuffled graph Bayes optimal classifier} is given by
\begin{align}
	h_*' &= \argmin_{h \in \mc{H}} L'(h), %, \qquad %\\
\end{align}
where $\mc{H}$ is again the set of possible labeled (or shuffled) graph classifiers. The \emph{shuffled Bayes risk} is given by
\begin{align}
	% h_*' &= \argmin_{h \in \mc{H}} L'(h), \qquad %\\
	L_*' =\min_{h \in \mc{H}} L'(h),
\end{align}
where  $L_*'$ implicitly depends on $\PP_{\QQ(\GG),Y}$.  % \defb

\subsection{Bayes Optimal Unlabeled Graph Classifiers} % (fold)


An \emph{unlabeled} graph classifier $\mt{h}\colon \mt{\mc{G}}_n \to \mc{Y}$ is any function that maps from unlabeled graph space to class space. The risk under $0-1$ loss is given by $\mt{L}(\mt{h})=\EE[\mt{h}(\mt{\GG})\neq Y]$, where the expectation is taken against $\PP_{\mt{\GG},Y}$.

\subsection{Parametric Classifiers} % (fold)
\label{sub:parametric_classifiers}

% subsection parametric_classifiers (end)

The three Bayes optimal graph classifiers can be written explicitly in terms of their model parameters:
\begin{align}
	h_*(G) &= \argmax_{y \in \mc{Y}} \theta_{G|y}\pi_y, \\
	h_*'(G) &= \argmax_{y \in \mc{Y}} \theta_{G|y}' \pi_y, \\
	\mt{h}_*(\mt{G}) &= \argmax_{y \in \mc{Y}}  \mt{\theta}_{\mt{G}|y}\pi_y. \label{eq:unbayes2}
\end{align}


% section bayes_optimal_graph_classifiers (end)


\section{Shuffling Can Degrade Optimal Performance} % (fold)
\label{sec:shuffle}


% For brevity, we will use the shorthand $\PP_y=\PP_{\GG | Y = y}=\theta_{G|y}$, $\mt{\PP}_y=\PP_{\mt{\GG} | Y = y}=\mt{\theta}_{\mt{G}|y}$ and $\PP'_y=\PP_{\GG'|Y=y}'=\theta_{G'|y}'$. 



The result of either shuffling or unlabeling a graph can only degrade, but not improve Bayes risk.  This is a restatement of the data processing lemma for this scenario. Specifically, \cite{DEV96} shows that the data processing lemma indicates that in the classification domain $L^*_X \leq L^*_{T(X)}$ for any transformation $T$ and data $X$.  In our setting, this becomes:

\begin{thm} \label{thm:1}
$L_* \leq \mt{L}_*=L_*'$.
\end{thm}

\begin{proof}
	Assume for simplicity $|\mc{Y}|=2$ and $\pi_0=\pi_1=1/2$.  
\begin{align} \label{eq:thm1}
	\mt{L}_*&=\sum_{\mt{G} \in \mt{\mc{G}}_n} \min_y  \mt{\theta}_{\mt{G}|y}  
	=\sum_{\mt{G} \in \mt{\mc{G}}_n} \min_y  \sum_{G \in \mt{G}}\theta_{G|y}'  = L_*' \nonumber \\
	&=\sum_{\mt{G} \in \mt{\mc{G}}_n} \min_y  \sum_{G \in \mt{G}}\theta_{G|y} 
	 \geq \sum_{\mt{G} \in \mt{\mc{G}}_n} \sum_{G \in \mt{G}} \min_y  \theta_{G|y}  = L_*.
	% & \geq \sum_{\mt{G} \in \mt{\mc{G}}_n}\sum_{G' \in \mt{G}}\min_y\PP_y(G')=L_*.
\end{align}
% It is trivially true that $\mt{L}_*=L_*'$.
\end{proof}



An immediate consequence of the above proof is that the inequality in the statement of Theorem \ref{thm:1} strict whenever the inequality in Eq. \eqref{eq:thm1} is strict:

\begin{thm} \label{thm:2}
	$L_* < \mt{L}_*=L'_*$ if and only if there exists $\mt{G}$ such that
	% $$\min_y \mt{\PP}_{y}(\mt{G}) > \sum_{G' \in \mt{G}}\min_y\PP_y(G').$$
	$$\min_y \mt{\theta}_{\mt{G}|y} > \sum_{G \in \mt{G}}\min_y \theta_{G|y}.$$
\end{thm}
The above result demonstrates that even when the labels \emph{do} carry some class-conditional signal, it may be the case that shuffling or unlabeling does not degrade performance.  In other words, to state that labels contain information is equivalent to stating that some graphs within an isomorphism set are class-conditionally more likely than others: $\exists \, \theta_{G_i|y} \neq \theta_{G_j|y}$ where $\Qs(G_i)=G_j$ for some $G_i,G_j \in \mc{G}_n$, $\Qs \in \mc{Q}_n$, and $y \in \mc{Y}$%, and that $\theta_{G_i|y}\neq \theta_{G_i|y'}$ or $\theta_{G_j|y}\neq \theta_{G_j|y'}$
.  Shuffling has the effect of ``flattening'' likelihoods within isomorphism sets, from $\bth_y$ to $\bth_y'$, so that $\bth_y'$ satisfies $\{\theta_{G|y}'=\mt{\theta}_{\mt{G}|y}/|\mt{G}| \, \forall \colon G \in \mt{G}\}$.  But just because the shuffling changes class-conditional likelihoods does \emph{not} mean that Bayes risk must also change. This result follows immediately upon realizing that posteriors can change without classification performance changing.  The above results are easily extended to consider non-equal class priors and $c$-class classification problems.  To see this, ignoring ties, simply replace each minimum likelihod with a sum over all non-maximum posteriors: 
% $$\min_y \PP_y(G) \to \sum_{y \in \mc{Y}'} \PP_y(G) \text{ where } \mc{Y}' =\{y : y \neq \argmax_y \PP_y\}.$$
$$\min_y \theta_{G|y} \pi_y \mapsto \sum_{y \in \mc{Y}'} \theta_{G|y} \pi_y \text{ where } \mc{Y}' =\{y \colon y \neq \argmax_y \theta_{G|y}\}.$$


\section{Bayes Optimal Graph Invariant Classification After Shuffling} % (fold)
\label{sec:gi}

A graph invariant on $\mc{G}_n$ is any function $\psi$  such that $\psi(G)=\psi(\Qs(G))$ for all $G \in \mc{G}_n$ and $\Qs \in \mc{Q}_n$.  A graph invariant classifier is a composition of a classifier with an invariant function, $h^\psi=f^\psi \circ \psi$.  The Bayes optimal graph invariant classifier minimizes risk over all invariants: 
\begin{align} \label{eq:psi}
	h_*^{\psi}=\argmin_{\psi \in \Psi, f^{\psi} \in \mc{F}^{\psi}} \EE[f(\psi(\GG))\neq Y],
\end{align}
where $\Psi$ is the space of all possible invariants and $\mc{F}^{\psi}$ is the space of classifiers composable with invariant $\psi$. The expectation in Eq. \eqref{eq:psi} is taken against $\PP_{\GG,Y}$ or equivalently $\PP_{\QQ(\GG),Y}$, since invariants are invariant.
  Let $L_*^{\psi}$ denote the Bayes invariant risk.  
\begin{thm} \label{thm:3}
	$\mt{L}_*=L_*^\psi$.
\end{thm}

\begin{proof}
Let $\psi$ indicate in which equivalence set $G$ resides; that is,  $\psi(G)=\mt{G}$ if and only if $G \in \mt{G}$.  Then
% $f_{G'}(G)$ be a graph matching function; that is, $f\colon \mc{G}_n \times \mc{G}_n \to \{0,1\}$, taking value unity whenever $G$ and $G'$ are isomorphic to one another.  Let $\psi(G)=\mb{f}(G)$, where $\mb{f}=(f_{G_1}, \ldots, f_{G_{\mt{d}}})$.  In words, $\phi(G)$ outputs a vector of length $\mt{d}_n$ with a single non-zero entry in the isomorphism set of $G$.  Let $h^{\psi}$ be an indicator function for the maximum a posteriori class of the corresponding isomorphism set. For instance, if $G \in \mt{G}_j$, then
\begin{align}
	h^{\psi}_*(G)= \argmax_{y \in \mc{Y}} \mt{\theta}_{\psi(G)|y} \pi_y = \argmax_{y \in \mc{Y}} \mt{\theta}_{\mt{G}|y} \pi_y = \mt{h}_*(G).
\end{align}
% Thus, this graph invariant based classifier is the unlabeled Bayes optimal classifier.
\end{proof}



\section{A consistent and efficient unshuffling classifier} % (fold)
\label{sec:bayes_optimal_graph_invariant_based_classifier}


Section \ref{sec:shuffle} shows that one cannot fruitfully ``unshuffle'' graphs: once they have been shuffled by a uniform shuffler, the label information is lost.  Section \ref{sec:gi} shows that if graphs have been uniformly shuffled, there is a relatively straightforward algorithm for optimal classification. However, that classifier depends on knowing the parameters, $\mt{\bth}=\{\mt{\bth}_y\}_{y\in \mc{Y}}$ and $\mb{\pi}=\{\pi_y\}_{y \in \mc{Y}}$. Instead we consider the data are sampled identically and independently from some joint distribution.  $(\QQ_i,\GG_i,Y_i)\overset{iid}{\sim}\PP_{\QQ,\GG,Y}$.  For shuffled graph classification we observe only the \emph{training data} $\mc{T}_s=\{\GG_i',Y_i\}_{i \in [s]}$, where $\GG_i'=\QQ_i(\GG_i)$, and are thusly unable to observe useful vertex labels.  Moreover, $\PP_{\QQ}$ is uniform, so that all label information is both unavailable and irrecoverable.  Our task is to utilize training data to induce a classifier $\mh{h}_s\colon \mc{G}_n \times (\mc{G}_n \times \mc{Y})^s \to \mc{Y}$ that approximates $\mt{h}_*$ as closely as possible.  

An unlabeled graph Bayes \emph{plugin} classifier estimates the likelihood and prior terms and plugs them in to Eq. \eqref{eq:unbayes2}:
\begin{align} \label{eq:class}
	\mh{h}_s(\mt{G})=\argmax_{y\in\mc{Y}} \mh{\mt{\theta}}_{\mt{G}|y}\mh{\pi}_y. %, \text{ where } G\in \mt{G}_j.
\end{align}
Let $\mh{L}_s=L(\mh{h}_s)$ be the risk of the induced classifier using maximum likelihood to obtain the plugin estimate for Eq. \eqref{eq:class}. 

\begin{thm} \label{thm:4}
	$\mh{L}_s \conv \mt{L}^*$ as $s \conv \infty$.
\end{thm}

\begin{proof}
Because $\mt{\mc{G}}_n$ and $\mc{Y}$ are both finite, their respective maximum likelihood estimates are guaranteed consistent by the law of large numbers.  Hence,  the unlabeled graph Bayes plugin classifier is also consistent to $\mt{L}_*$ \cite{DEV96}.  %Formally, if $\mhb{\mt{\theta}} \conv \mb{\mt{\theta}}$ and $\mhb{\pi} \conv \mb{\pi}$ as $s \conv \infty$, then $\mh{L}_s \conv \mt{L}_*$ as $s\conv \infty$.  
% Thus, $\mh{h}_s \conv \mt{h}^*$ as $s \conv \infty$.
\end{proof}


% As described above, the class-conditional distributions of unlabeled graphs can be characterized as  categorical distributions, $\PP_{\mt{\GG}|Y=y}=\text{Cat}(\mb{\mt{\theta}}_y)$.  Because a categorical distribution is in the exponential family, the maximum likelihood estimate for its parameters are exist, are unique, consistent, and efficient.  Moreover, the class prior can also be represented as a categorical random-variable, and therefore has the same properties.  Taken together, these results demonstrate that the Bayes plugin unlabeled graph classifier is consistent and efficient.

\section{A Practical Approach to Shuffled Graph Classification} % (fold)

Although Eq. \eqref{eq:class} yields consistency from Theorem \ref{thm:4}, utilizing this is practically hopeless as it requires solving $s$ computationally difficult graph isomorphism problems, and acceptable performance will  typically require $s \gg \mt{d}_n$.  Specifically, using Eq. \eqref{eq:class} requires first enumerating  all $\mt{d}_n$ isomorphism sets, then determining in which isomorphism set the to-be-classified graph and each of the training graphs reside. There are no known polynomial time solvers for graph isomorphism \cite{Garey1979}.  This approach is therefore, in general, impractical on two levels: (i) the number of parameters to estimate, $\mt{d}_n$, is too large, and (ii) exact graph isomorphism is too computationally taxing.  We therefore consider a modified approach.

A $k_s$ nearest-neighbor ($k$NN) classifier 
using  Frobenius norm 
is universally consistent to $L_*$ for labeled graph classification as long as $k_s \conv \infty$ with $k_s/s \conv 0$ as $s \conv \infty$ \cite{VP09_super}. This non-parametric approach circumvents the need to estimate $\mt{d}_n$ parameters. 
For shuffled graphs, we use a graph-matched Frobenius norm as the distance function, 
\begin{align} \label{eq:d}
\delta(G_i,G_j)=\argmin_{Q \in \mc{Q}_n}\norm{Q(G_i)-G_j}_F^2.	
\end{align}
Eq. \eqref{eq:d} requires solving a graph matching problem, which is NP-hard.  Therefore, we instead use an inexact graph matching approach based on the quadratic assignment formulation described in \cite{VP11_QAP}, which is only cubic in $n$. % This strategy is only cubic instead of super-exponential in $n$.  
Note that while the $k$NN approach with exact matching maintains universal consistency to $L_*'$, $k$NN with inexact graph matching approximation may not be consistent.  

The $k$NN classifier for shuffled graphs proceeds as follows.  First, compute the graph-matched Frobenius norm distance between the test graph $G$ and all training graphs, $\{\delta_i=\delta(G,G_i)\}_{i \in [s]}$.  Second, order the graph/class pairs according to their distances, $\delta_{(1)} \leq \cdots \leq \delta_{(s)}$.  Finally, let the estimated class be the plurality class of the $k_s$ closest graphs; that is, $\mh{y}=\argmax_{y \in \mc{Y}} \sum_{i \in [k_s]} \II\{y_{(i)}=y\}$.   Collectively, we refer to this classification strategy as \emph{graph-matched} $k$NN (GM-$k$NN).

Because the number of possible graphs is finite given finite $n$, GM-$k$NN is universally consistent, leading to our final theorem:
\begin{thm} \label{thm:5}
	$\mh{L}_{kNN} \conv \mt{L}^*$ as $s \conv \infty$.
\end{thm}
The proof follows immediately from the extension of Stone's proof to the graph domain \cite{VP11_super}.

% If $k$NN converges faster than the empirical CDF approach, it ``must'' be because the distance function used effectively smoothes over ``nearby'' parameters in $\mtb{\theta}_y$, where nearby is defined by the chosen distance.  Therefore, to deal with the excessively large number of parameters problem mentioned above.

% \label{sec:simulated_experiment}
% 
% To demonstrate the practically of an isomorphism-based unlabeled graph classifier, we conduct the following simulated experiment. Sample $s+1$ triplets identically and independently from the joint shuffler/graph/class model, $(\QQ_i,\GG_i,Y_i)\overset{iid}{=}\PP_{\QQ}\PP_{\GG|Y} \pi_Y$, where $\PP_{\QQ}$ is uniform, and $\pi_Y$ is Bernoulli so $\pi_0=\pi_1=1/2$.  The edges are independent so the likelihood factorizes as above.  Specifically, we let $\PP_{uv|0}=$Bernoulli$(p_{uv|y})$, where $p_{uv|0} \overset{indep.}{\sim}$Uniform$(0,0.7)$, and $p_{uv|0}=p_{uv|1}+0.3$.  
% 
% We let $k_s=1$ for $s<10^6$ and then $k_s=1/s$ thereafter.

% Figure \ref{fig:1} shows the performance of this Bayes plugin classifier as a function of the number of training samples.  As we had hoped, performance monotonically increases towards optimal performance (gray dot), even though the graph matching algorithm we used was approximate.

\section{Unlabeled Connectome Classification} % (fold)
\label{sub:connectome_classification}

% Inspired by the simulated performance of our unlabeled graph classifier, we decided to try it on a real-world application.  
A ``connectome'' is a brain-graph in which vertices correspond to (groups of) neurons, and edges correspond to connections between them.  Diffusion Magnetic Resonance (MR) Imaging and related technologies are making the acquisition of MR connectomes routine \cite{Hagmann2010}.  49 subjects from the Baltimore Longitudinal Study on Aging comprise this data, with acquisition and connectome inference details as reported in \cite{Gray11}.  Each connectome yields a $70$ vertex simple graph (binary, symmetric, and hollow adjacency matrix).  Associated with each graph is class label based on the gender of the individual (24 males, 25 females).  Because the vertices are labeled, we can compare the results of having the labels and not having the labels.  The performance of a $1$NN algorithm is reported in Table \ref{tab:connectome}. When using the vertex labels, a ``labeled-$1$NN'' achieves $37\%$ misclassification rate.  Chance performance (only using the estimated prior) on this data is $49\%$.  These two numbers provide bounds on performance.  We then pass all the graphs through a shuffle channel, and implement GM-$1$NN using the graph-matched Frobenius norm in Eq. \eqref{eq:d}.  This approach yields $41\%$ misclassification rate, slightly worse than the labeled graph case.  Finally, we compare the performance of our graph-matched $1$NN algorithm with a more ``standard'' graph-invariant based algorithm, referred to as $\phi(G)$-$1$NN.  In particular, we compute the following 4 graph invariants for each graph: size, max-degree, a greedy approximation to maximum-average-degree, and scan-statistic (see \cite{PCP10} for details).  Thus, we obtain a $4 \times 49$ element matrix.  We linearly squash each row such that all the elements are in $(0,1)$.  Then, we implement a $1$NN classifier on this representation of the data, using the Euclidean norm as the distance.  This results in $43\%$ misclassification rate, slightly worse than the performance of our graph-matched $1$NN.  



% The performance of the independent edge model based Bayes plugin classifier for unlabeled graphs is similarly unimpressive.  We therefore develop a hybrid approach in which the independent edge model is assumed, and parameters are estimated using the vertex labels.  Given these estimates, we can use the QAP algorithm to match each test graph to the two likelihood matrices, and then use the Bayes plugin classifier.  This approach yields a $31\%$ misclassification rate. In contrast, a ``standard'' graph invariant based approach, which computes the graph invariants from \cite{PCP10}, and plugs them into various machine learning algorithms (including the winner \cite{Crammer2008}), yields misclassification rates as low as $25\%$.

% \begin{itemize}
% 	\item \textbf{Graph Classifier} A Bayes plugin graph classifier as described in \cite{VP11a}; that is, using the labels.
% 	\item \textbf{1-QAP} Estimate the parameters using training data \emph{with} vertex labels.  Then, shuffle the test graph, \qap it to each $\mh{\PP}_y$ matrix.  The  estimated the class is $\mh{y}=\argmax_{y \in \mc{Y}}QAP(G,\mh{\PP}_y)$.   
% 	\item \textbf{48-QAP} Permuting the vertex labels, then implement \texttt{$1$NN$\circ$\qapa}.
% 	% \item \textbf{AVG-QAP}  Permuting the vertex labels, \qapa each of the 48 training graphs to the test graph.  Then, given those permuted adjacency matrices, compute the average, and then implement a standard $1$NN classifier.
% 	\item \textbf{1NN-GI} Use the graph invariant approach as described above. We provide the normalized graph invariants as inputs into a number of standard classifiers, including $k$NN, linear classifiers, support vector machines, random forests, and CW. On this data, the CW classifier performed best; we therefore only report its results.

\section{Discussion}

In this work, we have address both the theoretical and practical limitations of classifying graphs with and without vertex labels.  Specifically, we show that shuffling the vertex labels results in an irretrievable situation, with a possible degradation of classification performance (Theorem \ref{thm:1}), though not necessarily, even if the vertex labels contained class-conditional signal (Theorem \ref{thm:2}).  Moreover, although one cannot hope to recover the vertex labels, one can obtain a Bayes optimal classifier by solving a large number of graph isomorphism problems (Theorem \ref{thm:3}).  When the distribution is unavailable, one can induce a consistent and efficient ``unshuffling'' classifier by using a graph-matching strategy (Theorem \ref{thm:4}).  Unfortunately, this is intractable in practice due to the difficulty of graph matching and the large number of isomorphism sets.  Instead, we propose a graph-matched $k$NN classifier, which is also proven to be universally consistent (Theorem \ref{thm:5}). Applying this $k$NN classifier to a problem of considerable scientific interest---classifying human MR connectomes---we find that even with a relatively small sample ($s=49$), the graph-matched $k$NN algorithm performs nearly as well as the $k$NN algorithm \emph{using} vertex labels, and slightly better than a $k$NN algorithm applied to a set of graph invariants proposed previously.  Thus, this theoretical insight has led to improved practical classification performance.  Extensions to weighted or (certain) attributed graphs are trivial.

% estimating them yields an asymptotically optimal classifier.  This suggest that efforts to estimate the vertex labels may yield useful classification results, outperforming ``standard'' graph-invariant based classifiers.  Via simulation we show that an approximate graph matching algorithm converges to the optimal performance with only about 500 training samples for a particular independent edge random graph model.   Finally, we demonstrate with connectome data that estimating the vertex labels can be useful, but that there remains room to grow to exceed misclassification performance of a carefully chosen graph invariant $\circ$ machine learning based approach on this data.   These connectome data, much like other collections of graphs, can also be equipped with both vertex and edge attributes.  As such, we hope to extend the results herein to consider the more general cases.
