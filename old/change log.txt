change log:

-- added defs 1-3

-- added last sentence of 2.2

-- added parenthetical comment after introducing training data in 5

-- added sentence before thm 4 to explain that Lhat_s is a r.v.

-- thm 4, cor 1 & 2: make convergence in p

-- thm 5: changed, and added corollary 3

-- defined 3 h^delta functions where we introduce their L

-- thm 6, cor 4 & 5: convergence in p


right before thm 7, define h

thm 5: inadmissable

thm 7: Edelta' \geq Edeltatidle for all s.
or
hdeltatilde dominates hdelta'

proof: deltatilda borrows strength.

now, given T, consider delta or deltatilde.  sometimes deltatilde 
(perhaps state without proof) 



classifier --> rule whenever appropriate.
